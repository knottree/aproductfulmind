   <p>We all want to be empathetic, that is: we want to be able to relate to others. Consciously limited empathy is a mindful approach to understanding how you fit in when conveying the needs of others. We are, first and foremost, observers.</p> 
<p>Empathy. It's a word you'll hear often in professional settings. According to dictionary.com, empathy is “the psychological identification with or vicarious experiencing of the emotions, thoughts, or attitudes of another”. That's just a fancy way of saying “the ability to feel what others feel”.</p>
    <p> A key facet of product management is the ability to relate the needs of users to those who can build features or other capabilities to address those needs. When we speak with users, we want to understand their “pain points” and challenges, then communicate those to our colleagues to implement solutions in a product or service.</p>
    <p>
        But what are we really hearing or seeing when we speak with users?
    </p>   
    <p>
        We are not seeing their “true self” or actual needs, much like they are not seeing who we are. We are seeing a version of them and their problems based on the context of the discussion. We are merely observing, not feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consciously limited empathy is the ability to step back and appreciate our role as an observer when speaking with others. A good product manager should be a good observer and should relay what they have learned in objective terms, including any assumptions they are making about the user or their needs. A bad product manager says they “speak on behalf of users.” This is a false narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consciously limited empathy extends beyond users: what about your colleagues helping you build or sell the product? Treat conversations with them like you would a user; it's not like you can read your colleagues' minds any better than a user's. Be aware of any assumptions you make - this will improve your communication and strengthen your team's trust.    
    </p>
    <p>
        During your next conversation today, be it with a user, colleague, or a friend, take a step back and think about what they are telling you and what you are telling them and remember: you are both just observing each other at that moment in time.
