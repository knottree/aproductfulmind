    We all ask and answer yes/no questions all the time. I'm sure you've encountered several already today, or are about to. It can be as simple as “You OK?” or “Do you want something to eat?”. Yes/no questions are easy and have an important role, but we need to be mindful of their limitations and try to avoid their traps.
</p>
<p>
    So - should You Ask Yes/No Questions?
</p>
<p>
    No.

    OK fine, I'll explain.

<p>
    During discussions with users, you may be tempted to ask them a question like “Would this feature address your most common challenge?” or “Do you think you'd use this?”
</p>
<p>
    These are dangerous questions.
</p>
<p>
    People are naturally helpful, and users are no different. If you ask them if something you think will help them will help them, then what incentive do they have to say “no”? Whatever answer they give may only serve to give you and your team a false sense of validation.
</p>
<p>
    Don't do this.
</p>
<p>
    Learn how to ask open-ended questions. These will challenge the user to be more honest without offending, and you'll get much more value out of the discussion. Instead of asking “Would you use this?” ask “How would you use this to address your biggest problem?” Whether the user can come up with a good answer or not, you will have at least learned something - and if they can't come up with a good answer, then maybe the feature isn't that important after all!.
</p>
<p>
    A good way to learn how to ask open-ended questions is to play a fun game called “Keep Them Talking” with a patient friend. Start by asking your friend something about their day, then try to ask no fewer than 10 open-ended questions to keep them talking.
</p>
<p>
    Here's the catch: you cannot repeat a question.
</p>
<p>
    It is more difficult than it sounds, but you will get better with practice. Give it a try.
