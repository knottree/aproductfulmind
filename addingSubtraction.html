    We are wired to build, not to destroy. Mindful subtraction is a necessary skill to combat product waste.

    Less is more. I'm sure you've heard that phrase before, but how often is it actually put into practice?

    Many of us are tempted to add content to a document or add a feature to help solve a user's problem. But in doing so, we often forget that these additions weigh on the user and can dilute the overall value of the product.

    Adding subtraction to your daily routine can help you identify when to remove clutter. It can also help you identify waste in both processes and products. Beware: others will try to add. Your job should be to subtract.

    Here's a little exercise: think of your bedtime routine; the set of activities you do before going to bed. It doesn't have to be your evening routine - pick anything you do on a daily basis. Now think of one activity within that routine you could do without. It is not easy. I didn't say it would be. What is important is that you think of something and wrestle with the idea for a minute or two.
