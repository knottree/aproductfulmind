   <p>Prioritization is something we all do every day, even if we are unaware we are doing it. Being mindful of the innate skills we have as humans - while avoiding approaches which are naturally difficult - is necessary when we attempt to prioritize.</p> 
<p>
    Prioritization is one of the most common activities in product management. You will often hear the engineering team ask about priority, often in the form of “what should we work on next?”
</p>
<p>
    There are many technical approaches to prioritization, which I will not cover here.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, let's focus on a fundamental skill that comes natural to humans: comparison.
</p>
<p>
    Comparing two things is easy. You just put them side by side and figure out which one is preferred. Oftentimes, your subconscious will give you clues about the right choice. This is natural, and powerful.
</p>
<p>
    The natural extension of comparison is to rank items by importance. When you rank items, you are actually just repeatedly comparing two items. That is why surveys which have you rank things are often easier - and more enjoyable - than surveys which ask you to rate or describe things. Think about that the next time you create a user survey: start with a ranking question.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a little prioritization exercise: rank the top 7-10 items in your “To Do” list. Jot down the items on index cards or sticky notes, then rank them. You'll be done in minutes.
