    Change is hard. Everyone knows this. Few truly acknowledge it. Being mindful of how a product or an idea fits within others' value systems - or even daily routines - is vital for adoption.
</p>
<p>
    When designing a product, you need to account for its role in the customer's daily life.

    Compatibility is my favorite of <em>Rogers' Five Factors</em> - I highly recommend you study Rogers' famous framework, by the way. Compatibility is my favorite because it is so often overlooked.

    This is probably due to ego. Product designers are so confident in their brilliance that they forget how difficult it is to overcome inertia. Even if a product solves every pain point a user may have, adoption may be blocked if the product disrupts the customer's everyday life too much.
</p>
<p>
    Compatibility is not limited to users. Think of the people you work with. They have their own values and daily lives. If you propose a new process or approach that is too disruptive, don't be surprised if your colleagues are sluggish to adopt.
</p>
<p>
    To become more mindful of compatibility, think of something you do every day. Perhaps it's a simple routine like what you do when you wake up or before going to bed. Now think of one way you would make that routine easier. Was the solution something grand or revolutionary? Probably not. That's how compatibility works.
