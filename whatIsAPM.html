    <i>A Productful Mind</i> is a daily, audio-based routine for current and prospective product managers who want to build specific skills that will help them become more effective. When we say “product manager”, we are referring to someone who defines what a product or service will offer to end users. If you are familiar with the classic “Four Ps of Marketing”, then think of <i>A Productful Mind</i> as focusing on the “Product” “P”.

    Each episode of <i>A Productful Mind</i> is built around an idea that is fundamental to “good” product management. There are only five episodes, none longer than three minutes. Try listening to one each day Monday through Friday as a start.
